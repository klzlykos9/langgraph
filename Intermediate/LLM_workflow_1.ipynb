      "\n",
      "*   **384,400 kilometers**\n",
      "*   **238,855 miles**\n",

      "\n",
      "### The Detailed Answer\n",
      "\n",
      "Because the Moon's orbit is elliptical, its distance from Earth changes constantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Perigee (Closest Point):** When the Moon is at its closest point to Earth, it is about **363,300 km (225,700 miles)** away. A full moon at perigee is often called a \"Supermoon\" because it appears slightly larger and brighter in the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Apogee (Farthest Point):** When the Moon is at its farthest point, it is about **405,500 km (252,000 miles)** away. A full moon at apogee is sometimes called a \"Micromoon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "### Putting the Distance in Perspective\n",
      "\n",
      "It can be hard to grasp just how far away that is. Here are a few ways to visualize it:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Fitting the Planets:** At its farthest point, you could fit all the other planets in our solar system (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) in the space between the Earth and the Moon.\n",
      "*   **Travel Time:**\n",
      "    *   **By Light:** It takes light (and radio waves) about **1.3 seconds** to travel from the Moon to the Earth.\n",
      "    *   **By Apollo Spacecraft:** It took the Apollo astronauts about **3 days** to reach the Moon.\n",
      "    *   **By Car:** If you could drive a car at a constant 100 km/h (62 mph), it would take you about **160 days** to drive the distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Fun Fact: The Moon is Moving Away!\n",
      "\n",
      "Scientists know the distance to the Moon with incredible precision (down to the millimeter!) by bouncing lasers off of special reflectors left on the surface by the Apollo astronauts.\n",
      "\n",
      "These measurements have confirmed that the Moon is slowly drifting away from Earth at a rate of about **3.8 centimeters (1.5 inches) per year**. This is caused by the tidal forces between the Earth and the Moon.\n"
